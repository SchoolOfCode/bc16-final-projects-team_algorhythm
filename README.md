## Algorhythm

<img src="./public/soclogo.png" width="100" align="right">
Algorhythm is a School of Code team who came together in the final four weeks of their bootcamp to plan, build and deploy a solution to a unique problem posed by their stakeholder, who in this case turned out to be the School of Code themselves.<br /><br />

After learning that the current learning management system was not nearly up to scratch, a solution had to be found, and the idea for SoCBrain was founded. It would be able to enhance the learning experience for all future bootcampers whilst simultaneously giving easy access to tracking metrics for the coaches to be able to tailor individual learning plans better for their students. <br /> <br />

<p><img align="right" alt="Algorhythm logo" src="./public/algologo.png" width="300">This fantastic team was made up by the following developers:

- Jack White
- Annamaria Koutsoras
- Igor Silva
- Callum Basnett
- Stephen Boyce
- Livia Genevieve Busseni
